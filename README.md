# PlasmaPy

An open source community developed Python 3.6+ package for plasma physics in 
the early stages of development. PlasmaPy intends to be for plasmas what
[Astropy](https://github.com/astropy/astropy) is for astronomy - a 
collection of functionality commonly used and shared between plasma physicists 
and researchers globally, running within and leveraging the open source 
scientific Python ecosystem. The goals of this project are more thoroughly described in our
[vision statement](vision_statement.md)
and [an earlier conference poster](http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.163752).

We created a guide on
[contributing to PlasmaPy](CONTRIBUTING.md) and have a [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
New contributors are very welcome!

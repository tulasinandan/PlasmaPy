PlasmaPy is an open source community developed Python 3.6+ package for
plasma physics in the early stages of development.  PlasmaPy intends to
be for plasmas what [Astropy](https://github.com/astropy/astropy) is for
astronomy - a collection of functionality commonly used and shared
between plasma physicists and researchers globally, running within and
leveraging the open source scientific Python ecosystem.  The goals of
this project are more thoroughly described in our [vision
statement](http://docs.plasmapy.org/en/stable/about/vision_statement.html)
and [this recent reference](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1238132).
We are in the process of writing [online
documentation](http://docs.plasmapy.org/en/latest/).

We created a guide on [contributing to
PlasmaPy](http://plasmapy.readthedocs.io/en/master/CONTRIBUTING.html)
and have a [Code of
Conduct](http://plasmapy.readthedocs.io/en/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.html).
New contributors are very welcome!

If you have any questions, the quickest way to get a response is to ask
on our
[Matrix](https://riot.im/app/#/room/#plasmapy:matrix.org)/[Gitter](https://gitter.im/PlasmaPy/Lobby)
channel.  For a slower response, you may also contact Nick Murphy at

## Installation

You can get PlasmaPy from pip via `pip install plasmapy`. To contribute
to the package, check out [our instructions on installing PlasmaPy from
source](INSTALL.md).

We're not on Conda yet, but we're working on it!

Like most scientific Python packages, PlasmaPy probably runs best on the
[Anaconda distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/downloads).

PlasmaPy requires Python 3.6+ and is [not compatible with
Python 2](https://pythonclock.org/).

"""Functions to calculate transport coefficients.

This module includes a number of functions for handling Coulomb collisions
spanning weakly coupled (low density) to strongly coupled (high density)
regimes.

Coulomb collisions
==================

Coulomb collisions are collisions where the interaction force is conveyed
via the electric field, instead of any kind of contact force. They usually
result in relatively small deflections of particle trajectories. However,
given that there are many charged particles in a plasma, one has to take
into account the cumulative effects of many such collisions.

Coulomb logarithms
==================

Please see the documentation for the `Coulomb logarithm <Coulomb_logarithm>`_
for a review of the many ways in which one can define and calculate
that quantity.

Collision rates
===============

The module gathers a few functions helpful for calculating collision
rates between particles. The most general of these is `collision_frequency`,
while if you need average values for a Maxwellian distribution, try
out `collision_rate_electron_ion` and `collision_rate_ion_ion`. These
use `collision_frequency` under the hood.

Macroscopic properties
======================

These include:
* `Spitzer_resistivity`
* `mobility`
* `Knudsen_number`
* `coupling_parameter`

    Estimates the Coulomb logarithm.

    Parameters
    ----------

    T : ~astropy.units.Quantity
        Temperature in units of temperature or energy per particle,
        which is assumed to be equal for both the test particle and
        the target particle.

    n_e : ~astropy.units.Quantity
        The electron density in units convertible to per cubic meter.

    particles : tuple
        A tuple containing string representations of the test particle
        (listed first) and the target particle (listed second).

    z_mean : ~astropy.units.Quantity, optional
        The average ionization (arithmetic mean) for a plasma where the
        a macroscopic description is valid. This is used to recover the
        average ion density (given the average ionization and electron
        density) for calculating the ion sphere radius for non-classical
        impact parameters.

    V : ~astropy.units.Quantity, optional
        The relative velocity between particles.  If not provided,
        thermal velocity is assumed: :math:`\mu V^2 \sim 2 k_B T`
        where `mu` is the reduced mass.

    method: str, optional
        Selects which theory to use when calculating the Coulomb
        logarithm. Defaults to classical method.

    Returns
    -------
    lnLambda : float or numpy.ndarray
        An estimate of the Coulomb logarithm that is accurate to
        roughly its reciprocal.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If the mass or charge of either particle cannot be found, or
        any of the inputs contain incorrect values.

    UnitConversionError
        If the units on any of the inputs are incorrect.

        If the n_e, T, or V are not Quantities.

    PhysicsError
        If the result is smaller than 1.

    RelativityError
        If the input velocity is same or greater than the speed
        of light.

    Warns
    -----
    ~astropy.units.UnitsWarning
        If units are not provided, SI units are assumed

    ~plasmapy.utils.RelativityWarning
        If the input velocity is greater than 5% of the speed of
        light.

    Notes
    -----
    The classical Coulomb logarithm is given by

    .. math::
        \ln{\Lambda} \equiv \ln\left( \frac{b_{max}}{b_{min}} \right)

    where :math:`b_{min}` and :math:`b_{max}` are the inner and outer
    impact parameters for Coulomb collisions [1]_.

    The outer impact parameter is given by the Debye length:
    :math:`b_{min} = \lambda_D` which is a function of electron
    temperature and electron density.  At distances greater than the
    Debye length, electric fields from other particles will be
    screened out due to electrons rearranging themselves.

    The choice of inner impact parameter is either the distance of closest
    approach for a 90 degree Coulomb collision or the thermal deBroglie
    wavelength, whichever is larger. This is because Coulomb-style collisions
    cannot occur for impact parameters shorter than the deBroglie
    wavelength because quantum effects will change the fundamental
    nature of the collision [2]_, [3]_.

    Errors associated with the classical Coulomb logarithm are of order its
    inverse. If the Coulomb logarithm is of order unity, then the
    assumptions made in the standard analysis of Coulomb collisions
    are invalid.

    For dense plasmas where the classical Coulomb logarithm breaks
    down there are various extended methods. These can be found
    in D.O. Gericke et al's paper, which has a table summarizing
    the methods [4]_. The GMS-1 through GMS-6 methods correspond
    to the methods found it that table.

    It should be noted that GMS-4 thru GMS-6 modify the Coulomb
    logarithm to the form:

    .. math::
        \ln{\Lambda} \equiv 0.5 \ln\left(1 + \frac{b_{max}^2}{b_{min}^2} \right)

    This means the Coulomb logarithm will not break down for Lambda < 0,
    which occurs for dense, cold plasmas.

    Methods
    ---
    Classical
        classical Landau-Spitzer approach. Fails for large coupling
        parameter where Lambda can become less than zero.
    GMS-1
        1st method listed in Table 1 of reference [3]
        Landau-Spitzer, but with interpolated bmin instead of bmin
        selected between deBroglie wavelength and distance of closest
        approach. Fails for large coupling
        parameter where Lambda can become less than zero.
    GMS-2
        2nd method listed in Table 1 of reference [3]
        Another Landau-Spitzer like approach, but now bmax is also
        being interpolated. The interpolation is between the Debye
        length and the ion sphere radius, allowing for descriptions
        of dilute plasmas. Fails for large coupling
        parameter where Lambda can become less than zero.
        3rd method listed in Table 1 of reference [3]
        classical Landau-Spitzer fails for argument of Coulomb logarithm
        Lambda < 0, therefore a clamp is placed at Lambda_min = 2
    GMS-4
        4th method listed in Table 1 of reference [3]
        Spitzer-like extension to Coulomb logarithm by noting that
        Coulomb collisions take hyperbolic trajectories. Removes
        divergence for small bmin issue in classical Landau-Spitzer
        approach, so bmin can be zero. Also doesn't break down as
        Lambda < 0 is now impossible, even when coupling parameter is large.
    GMS-5
        5th method listed in Table 1 of reference [3]
        Similar to GMS-4, but setting bmin as distance of closest approach
        and bmax interpolated between Debye length and ion sphere radius.
        Lambda < 0 impossible.
    GMS-6
        6th method listed in Table 1 of reference [3]
        Similar to GMS-4 and GMS-5, but using interpolation methods
        for both bmin and bmax.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from astropy import units as u
    >>> n = 1e19*u.m**-3
    >>> T = 1e6*u.K

    The minimum and maximum impact parameters may be calculated in a

    .. math::
        b_{max} = \left(\lambda_{De}^2 + a_i^2\right)^{1/2}

    The minimum impact parameter is typically some combination of the
    thermal deBroglie wavelength and the distance of closest approach
    for a 90 degree Coulomb collision. A quadratic sum is used for
    all GMS methods, except for GMS-5, where b_min is simply set to
    the distance of closest approach [1]_.

    r"""Collision frequency of particles in a plasma.

    Parameters
    ----------

    T : ~astropy.units.Quantity
        Temperature in units of temperature.
        This should be the electron temperature for electron-electron
        and electron-ion collisions, and the ion temperature for
        ion-ion collisions.


    n : ~astropy.units.Quantity
        The density in units convertible to per cubic meter.
        This should be the electron density for electron-electron collisions,
        and the ion density for electron-ion and ion-ion collisions.

    particles : tuple
        A tuple containing string representations of the test particle
        (listed first) and the target particle (listed second)

    z_mean : ~astropy.units.Quantity, optional
        The average ionization (arithmetic mean) for a plasma where the
        a macroscopic description is valid. This is used to recover the
        average ion density (given the average ionization and electron
        density) for calculating the ion sphere radius for non-classical
        impact parameters.

    V : ~astropy.units.Quantity, optional
        The relative velocity between particles.  If not provided,
        thermal velocity is assumed: :math:`\mu V^2 \sim 2 k_B T`
        where `mu` is the reduced mass.

    method: str, optional
        Selects which theory to use when calculating the Coulomb
        logarithm. Defaults to classical method.

    Returns
    -------
    freq : float or numpy.ndarray
        The collision frequency of particles in a plasma.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If the mass or charge of either particle cannot be found, or
        any of the inputs contain incorrect values.

    UnitConversionError
        If the units on any of the inputs are incorrect

    TypeError
        If the n_e, T, or V are not Quantities.

    RelativityError
        If the input velocity is same or greater than the speed
        of light.

    Warns
    -----
    ~astropy.units.UnitsWarning
        If units are not provided, SI units are assumed

    ~plasmapy.utils.RelativityWarning
        If the input velocity is greater than 5% of the speed of
        light.

    Notes
    -----
    The collision frequency is given by [1]_

    .. math::
        \nu = n \sigma v \ln{\Lambda}

    where n is the particle density, :math:`\sigma` is the collisional
    cross-section, :math:`v` is the inter-particle velocity (typically
    taken as the thermal velocity), and :math:`\ln{\Lambda}` is the Coulomb
    logarithm accounting for small angle collisions.

    See eq (2.14) in [2]_.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from astropy import units as u
    >>> n = 1e19*u.m**-3
    >>> T = 1e6*u.K
    >>> particles = ('e', 'p')
    >>> collision_frequency(T, n, particles)

    frequency with an averaging factor, and is on many occasions in transport theory

    related to diffusion and resistivity in plasmas.

    Parameters
    ----------
    T_e : ~astropy.units.Quantity
        The electron temperature of the Maxwellian test electrons

    n_e : ~astropy.units.Quantity
        The number density of the Maxwellian test electrons

    ion_particle: str

    V : ~astropy.units.Quantity, optional
        The relative velocity between particles.  If not provided,
        thermal velocity is assumed: :math:`\mu V^2 \sim 2 k_B T`
        where `mu` is the reduced mass.

    coulomb_log : float or dimensionless ~astropy.units.Quantity, optional
        Option to specify a Coulomb logarithm of the electrons on the ions.
        If not specified, the Coulomb log will is calculated using the

    coulomb_log_method : string, optional
        Method used for Coulomb logarithm calculation (see that function
        for more documentation). Choose from "classical" or "GMS-1" to "GMS-6".

    Notes
    -----
    Equations (2.17) and (2.120) in [3]_ provide the original source used
    to implement this formula, however, the simplest form that connects our average
    collision frequency to the general collision frequency is is this (from 2.17):

    .. math::
        \nu_e = \frac{4}{3 \sqrt{\pi}} \nu(v_{Te})

    Where :math:`\nu` is the general collision frequency and :math:`v_{Te}`
    is the electron thermal velocity (the average, for a Maxwellian distribution).

    This implementation of the average collision frequency is is equivalent to:
    * 1/tau_e from ref [1]_ eqn (2.5e) pp. 215,
    * nu_e from ref [2]_ pp. 33,

    coulomb_log : float or dimensionless ~astropy.units.Quantity, optional
        Option to specify a Coulomb logarithm of the electrons on the ions.

        ~plasmapy.physics.transport.Coulomb_logarithm function.

        Method used for Coulomb logarithm calculation (see that function
        for more documentation). Choose from "classical" or "GMS-1" to "GMS-6".

    Notes
    -----
    Equations (2.36) and (2.122) in [3]_ provide the original source used
    to implement this formula, however, in our implementation we use the very
    same process that leads to the fundamental electron collison rate (2.17),
    gaining simply a different coefficient:

    .. math::
        \nu_i = \frac{8}{3 * 4 * \sqrt{\pi}} \nu(v_{Ti})

    Where :math:`\nu` is the general collision frequency and :math:`v_{Ti}`
    is the ion thermal velocity (the average, for a Maxwellian distribution).

    Note that in the derivation, it is assumed that electrons are present
    in such numbers as to establish quasineutrality, but the effects of the
    test ions colliding with them are not considered here. This is a very
    typical approximation in transport theory.

    This result is an ion momentum relaxation rate, and is used in many
    classical transport expressions. It is equivalent to:
    * 1/tau_i from ref [1]_, equation (2.5i) pp. 215,
    * nu_i from ref [2]_ pp. 33,

    V : ~astropy.units.Quantity, optional
        The relative velocity between particles.  If not provided,
        thermal velocity is assumed: :math:`\mu V^2 \sim 2 k_B T`
        where `mu` is the reduced mass.

    method: str, optional
        Selects which theory to use when calculating the Coulomb
        logarithm. Defaults to classical method.

    knudsen_param : float or numpy.ndarray
        The dimensionless Knudsen number.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If the mass or charge of either particle cannot be found, or
        any of the inputs contain incorrect values.

    UnitConversionError
        If the units on any of the inputs are incorrect

    TypeError
        If the n_e, T, or V are not Quantities.

    RelativityError
        If the input velocity is same or greater than the speed
        of light.

    -----
    ~astropy.units.UnitsWarning
        If units are not provided, SI units are assumed

    ~plasmapy.utils.RelativityWarning
        If the input velocity is greater than 5% of the speed of
        light.

    Notes
    -----
    The Knudsen number is given by [1]_

    .. math::
        Kn = \frac{\lambda_{mfp}}{L}

    where :math:`\lambda_{mfp}` is the collisional mean free path for
    particles in a plasma and :math`L` is the characteristic scale
    length of interest.

    Typically the characteristic scale length is the plasma size or the
    size of a diagnostic (such a the length or radius of a Langmuir
    probe tip). The Knudsen number tells us whether collisional effects
    are important on this scale length.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from astropy import units as u
    >>> L = 1e-3 * u.m
    >>> n = 1e19*u.m**-3
    >>> T = 1e6*u.K
    >>> particles = ('e', 'p')
    >>> Knudsen_number(L, T, n, particles)
    <Quantity 7839.36310417>
    >>> Knudsen_number(L, T, n, particles, V=1e6 * u.m / u.s)

    r"""Coupling parameter.
    Coupling parameter compares Coulomb energy to kinetic energy (typically)
    thermal. Classical plasmas are weakly coupled Gamma << 1, whereas dense
    plasmas tend to have significant to strong coupling Gamma >= 1.

    Parameters
    ----------

    T : ~astropy.units.Quantity
        Temperature in units of temperature or energy per particle,
        which is assumed to be equal for both the test particle and
        the target particle

    n_e : ~astropy.units.Quantity
        The electron density in units convertible to per cubic meter.

    particles : tuple
        A tuple containing string representations of the test particle
        (listed first) and the target particle (listed second)

    z_mean : ~astropy.units.Quantity, optional
        The average ionization (arithmetic mean) for a plasma where the
        a macroscopic description is valid. This is used to recover the
        average ion density (given the average ionization and electron
        density) for calculating the ion sphere radius for non-classical
        impact parameters.

    V : ~astropy.units.Quantity, optional
        The relative velocity between particles.  If not provided,
        thermal velocity is assumed: :math:`\mu V^2 \sim 2 k_B T`
        where `mu` is the reduced mass.

    method: str, optional
        Selects which theory to use when calculating the Coulomb
        logarithm. Defaults to classical method.

    Returns
    -------
    coupling : float or numpy.ndarray
        The coupling parameter for a plasma.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If the mass or charge of either particle cannot be found, or
        any of the inputs contain incorrect values.

    UnitConversionError
        If the units on any of the inputs are incorrect

    TypeError
        If the n_e, T, or V are not Quantities.

    RelativityError
        If the input velocity is same or greater than the speed
        of light.

    Warns
    -----
    ~astropy.units.UnitsWarning
        If units are not provided, SI units are assumed

    ~plasmapy.utils.RelativityWarning
        If the input velocity is greater than 5% of the speed of
        light.

    Notes
    -----
    The coupling parameter is given by

    .. math::
        \Gamma = \frac{E_{Coulomb}}{E_{Kinetic}}

    The Coulomb energy is given by

    .. math::
        E_{Coulomb} = \frac{Z_1 Z_2 q_e^2}{4 \pi \epsilon_0 r}

    where :math:`r` is the Wigner-Seitz radius, and 1 and 2 refer to
    particle species 1 and 2 between which we want to determine the
    coupling.

    In the classical case the kinetic energy is simply the thermal energy

    .. math::
        E_{kinetic} = k_B T_e

    The quantum case is more complex. The kinetic energy is dominated by
    the Fermi energy, modulated by a correction factor based on the
    ideal chemical potential. This is obtained more precisely
    by taking the the thermal kinetic energy and dividing by
    the degeneracy parameter, modulated by the Fermi integral [1]_

    .. math::
        E_{kinetic} = 2 k_B T_e / \chi f_{3/2} (\mu_{ideal} / k_B T_e)

    where :math:`\chi` is the degeneracy parameter, :math:`f_{3/2}` is the
    Fermi integral, and :math:`\mu_{ideal}` is the ideal chemical
    potential.

    The degeneracy parameter is given by

    .. math::
        \chi = n_e \Lambda_{deBroglie} ^ 3

    where :math:`n_e` is the electron density and :math:`\Lambda_{deBroglie}`
    is the thermal deBroglie wavelength.

    See equations 1.2, 1.3 and footnote 5 in [2]_ for details on the ideal
    chemical potential.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from astropy import units as u
    >>> n = 1e19*u.m**-3
    >>> T = 1e6*u.K
    >>> particles = ('e', 'p')
    >>> coupling_parameter(T, n, particles)
    <Quantity 5.80330315e-05>

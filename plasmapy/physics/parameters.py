r"""Values should be returned as an Astropy Quantity in SI units.

If a quantity has several names, then the function name should be the
one that provides the most physical insight into what the quantity
represents.  For example, 'gyrofrequency' indicates gyration, while
Larmor frequency indicates that this frequency is somehow related to a
human (or perhaps a cat?) named Larmor.  Similarly, using omega_ce as
a function name for this quantity will make the code less readable to
people who are unfamiliar with the notation or use a different symbol.

The docstrings for plasma parameter methods should describe the
physics associated with these quantities in ways that are
understandable to students who are taking their first course in plasma
physics while still being useful to experienced plasma physicists.

In many cases, units are enough to tell what field a quantity
represents.  The following line is an example.

>>> Alfven_speed(5*units.T, 8e-7*units.kg/units.m**3)

However, some plasma parameters depend on more than one quantity with
the same units.  In the following line, it is difficult to discern which
is the electron temperature and which is the ion temperature.

>>> ion_sound_speed(1e6*units.K, 2e6*units.K)

Remembering that "explicit is better than implicit", it is more
readable and less prone to errors to write:

>>> ion_sound_speed(T_i=1e6*units.K, T_e=2e6*units.K)

SI units that were named after a person should be lower case except at
the beginning of a sentence, even if their symbol is capitalized. For
example, kelvin is a unit while Kelvin was a scientist.

Unit conversions involving angles must be treated with care.  Angles
are dimensionless but do have units.  Angular velocity is often
given in units of radians per second, though dimensionally this is
equivalent to inverse seconds.  Astropy will treat radians
dimensionlessly when using the dimensionless_angles() equivalency,
but dimensionless_angles() does not account for multiplicative
factor of 2*pi that is used when converting between frequency (1 /
s) and angular velocity (rad / s).  A clear way to do this
conversion is to set up an equivalency between cycles/s and Hz:

>>> from astropy import units
>>> f_ce = omega_ce.to(units.Hz, equivalencies=[(units.cy/units.s, units.Hz)])

However, dimensionless_angles() does work when dividing a velocity
by an angular frequency to get a length scale:

>>> d_i = (c/omega_pi).to(units.m, equivalencies=units.dimensionless_angles())

def Alfven_speed(B, density, ion="p"):
    r"""Returns the Alfven speed.

    Parameters
    ----------
    B : Quantity
        The magnetic field magnitude in units convertible to tesla.

    density : Quantity
        Either the ion number density in units convertible to 1 / m**3,
        or the mass density in units convertible to kg / m**3.

    ion : string, optional
        Representation of the ion species (e.g., 'p' for protons, 'D+'
        for deuterium, or 'He-4 +1' for singly ionized helium-4),
        which defaults to protons.  If no charge state information is
        provided, then the ions are assumed to be singly charged.

    Returns
    -------
    V_A : Quantity with units of velocity
        The Alfven velocity of the plasma in units of meters per second.

    Raises
    ------
    TypeError
        The magnetic field and density arguments are not Quantities and
        cannot be converted into Quantities.

    UnitConversionError
        If the magnetic field or density is not in appropriate units.

    UserWarning
        If the Alfven velocity exceeds 10% of the speed of light, or
        if units are not provided and SI units are assumed.

    ValueError
        If the density is negative, or the ion mass or charge state
        cannot be found.

    Notes
    -----
    The Alfven velocity :math:`V_A` is the typical propagation speed
    of magnetic disturbances in a plasma, and is given by:

    .. math::
        V_A = \frac{B}{\sqrt{\mu_0\rho}}

    where the mass density is :math:`\rho = n_i m_i + n_e m_e`.

    This expression does not account for relativistic effects, and
    loses validity when the resulting speed is a significant fraction
    of the speed of light.

    This function switches B and density when B has units of number
    density or mass density and density has units of magnetic field
    strength.

    r"""Returns the ion sound speed for an electron-ion plasma.

    Parameters
    ----------
    T_e : Quantity, optional
        Electron temperature in units of temperature or energy per

        is assumed to be zero.  If only one temperature is entered, it

        assumed to be zero.

    gamma_e : float or int
        The adiabatic index for electrons, which defaults to 1.  This
        value assumes that the electrons are able to equalize their
        temperature rapidly enough that the electrons are effectively
        isothermal.

    gamma_i : float or int
        The adiabatic index for ions, which defaults to 3.  This value
        assumes that ion motion has only one degree of freedom, namely
        along magnetic field lines.

    ion : string, optional
        Representation of the ion species (e.g., 'p' for protons, 'D+'
        for deuterium, or 'He-4 +1' for singly ionized helium-4),
        which defaults to protons.  If no charge state information is

    Returns
    -------
    V_S : Quantity
        The ion sound speed in units of meters per second.

    Raises
    ------
    TypeError
        If any of the arguments are not entered as keyword arguments
        or are of an incorrect type.

    ValueError
        If the ion mass, adiabatic index, or temperature are invalid.

    UnitConversionError
        If the temperature is in incorrect units.

    UserWarning
        If the ion sound speed exceeds 10% of the speed of light, or
        if units are not provided and SI units are assumed.

    Notes
    -----
    The ion sound speed :math:`V_S` is approximately given by

    .. math::
        V_S = \sqrt{\frac{\gamma_e Z k_B T_e + \gamma_i k_B T_i}{m_i}}

    where :math:`\gamma_e` and :math:`\gamma_i` are the electron and
    ion adiabatic indices, :math:`k_B` is the Boltzmann constant,
    :math:`T_e` and :math:`T_i` are the electron and ion temperatures,
    :math:`Z` is the charge state of the ion, and :math:`m_i` is the
    ion mass.

    This function assumes that the product of the wavenumber and the
    Debye length is small. In this limit, the ion sound speed is not
    dispersive (e.g., frequency independent).

    When the electron temperature is much greater than the ion
    temperature, the ion sound velocity reduces to
    :math:`\sqrt{\gamma_e k_B T_e / m_i}`.  Ion acoustic waves can
    therefore occur even when the ion temperature is zero.

    This function yields the most probable speed within a distribution

    the square root of two depending on whether or not this velocity
    absorbs that factor in the expression for a Maxwellian

    Parameters

    particle : string, optional
        Representation of the particle species (e.g., 'p' for protons, 'D+'

    The particle plasma frequency is

    frequency.  The dimensionless_angles equivalency allows that
    conversion, but does not account for the factor of 2*pi. The
    alternatives are to convert to cycle/second or to do the
    conversion manually, as shown in the examples.

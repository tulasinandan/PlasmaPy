Testing Guidelines

Testing
=======

PlasmaPy uses pytest for its testing needs.

The simplest way to run tests on your development branch, assuming you
submitted it as a pull request, is to just push your code to GitHub. The Travis
CI integration runs tests on every uploaded commit.

To run the test suite locally, use ``pytest`` from the repository's root
directory.  This should detect our ``setup.cfg`` file and thus also verify
examples in docstrings.


A few guidelines to on writing neat, readable and useful tests:

* Unit tests should be provided for all methods when possible.

* Solved bugs should be turned into test cases.
  
* The Travis CI integration on GitHub runs tests whenever pull
  requests to PlasmaPy are updated.  The pytest module may used on a
  local computer.
  
* Tests are run frequently during code development, and slow tests may
  interrupt the flow of a contributor.  Tests should be minimal, sufficient enough to
  be complete and as efficient as possible.


Assert statements
=================
* Pytest runs tests by checking ``assert`` statements, so this is sufficient:

.. code-block:: python

  def test_universe_is_sane():
      assert 2 + 2 == 4

However, making assertions descriptive is better in most cases:

.. code-block:: python

  def test_universe_is_sane():
      assert 2 + 2 == 4, "Addition is broken. Reinstall the universe and reboot."

pytest should display the value of the ``2 + 2`` expression, but the value can be added to the thrown string:

.. code-block:: python

  def test_universe_is_sane():
      assert 2 + 2 == 4, f"Addition is broken, 2 + 2 giving {2 + 2}. Reinstall the universe and reboot."

A note on test independence and parametrization
===============================================

In this section, we'll discuss the issue of parametrization based on an example
of a `proof <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann\_hypothesis#Excluded\_middle>`_ of Gauss's class number conjecture.

The proof goes along these lines: 
* If the generalized Riemann hypothesis is true, the conjecture is true.
* If the former is false, the latter is also true.
* Therefore, the latter is true.

One way to use pytest for testing is to write continuous assertions:

.. code-block:: python

  def test_proof_by_riemann_hypothesis():
       # if this step fails, the test stops
       assert proof_by_riemann(False) 
       # and you have to run this again
       assert proof_by_riemann(True) 

To do this the right way, what you technically should do to make the tests independent:

.. code-block:: python

  def test_proof_if_riemann_false():
       assert proof_by_riemann(False)
  def test_proof_if_riemann_true():
       assert proof_by_riemann(True)

but that's a lot of typing so what you actually do is use pytest parametrization:

.. code-block:: python

  @pytest.mark.parametrize("truth", [True, False])
  def test_proof_if_riemann(truth):
       assert proof_by_riemann(truth)

And both of these are going to run regardless of failures, which is awesome!

Of course, with qualitatively different tests you would use either separate functions or you'd pass in pairs of inputs and expected values:

.. code-block:: python

  @pytest.mark.parametrize("truth,expected", [(True, True), (False, True)])
  def test_proof_if_riemann(truth, expected):
       assert proof_by_riemann(truth) == expected

Code coverage
=============

PlasmaPy uses the coverage.py addon via Coveralls.io. At the end of every
Travis CI testing session, information on which lines were executed in the test
is sent to Coveralls.io. At the very least, try to avoid test coverage
decreasing if possible.

To run coverage.py locally, run ``coverage run -m pytest``, then generate a HTML
description with ``coverage html``.

At the time of writing this, coverage.py has a known issue with being
unable to check lines executed in Numba JIT compiled functions.
  
Occasionally there will be some lines that do not require testing.  For
example, testing exception handling for an `ImportError` when importing an
external package would usually be impractical.  In these instances, we may end
a line with `# coveralls: ignore` to indicate that these lines should be
excluded from coverage reports (or add a line to `.coveragerc`).  This strategy
should be used sparingly, since it is often better to explicitly test
exceptions and warnings and to show the lines of code that are not tested.
